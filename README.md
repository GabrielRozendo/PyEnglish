# PyEnglish
An idea to do something cool, using Python to learn a new language, in a collaborative and open source repository...

## Idea
I've proposed to friends we create something in python, maybe crawling a nyt news or using a API to show everyday a news in English and then we all should ask and answer it... then we can evolute to ask automatically questions, getting the answers and analysing... using ML to interpretation, so the sky is the limit =)  Them've accepted! So now we can practice python and learning English in same time!
